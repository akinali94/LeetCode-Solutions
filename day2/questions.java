/* Question 1
 * String Compression: 
 * Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters.
 * For example, the string aabcccccaaa would become a2blc5a3. If the "compressed" string would not 
 * become smaller than the original string, your method should return the original string. 
 * You can assume the string has only uppercase and lowercase letters (a - z).
*/

/* Question 2
 * Sorted Matrix Search: 
 * Given an M x N matrix in which each row and each column is sorted 
 * in ascending order, write a method to find an element.
*/

/* Question 3
 * Check Balanced: 
 * Implement a function to check if a binary tree is balanced. 
 * For the purposes of this question, a balanced tree is defined to be a tree 
 * such that the heights of the two subtrees of any node never differ by more than one.
*/

/* Question 4
 * Three in One: 
 * Describe how you could use a single array to implement three stacks.
*/

/* Question 5
 * Partition: Write code to partition a linked list around a value x, such 
 * that all nodes less than x come before all nodes greater than or equal to x. 
 * If x is contained within the list, the values of x only need to be after the 
 * elements less than x (see below). The partition element x can appear anywhere 
 * in the "right partition"; it does not need to appear between the left and right partitions.
 * 
 * EXAMPLE
 * Input: 3 -&gt; 5 -&gt; 8 -&gt; 5 -&gt; 10 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 1 [partition=5] 
 * Output: 3 -&gt; 1 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 10 -&gt; 5 -&gt; 5 -&gt; 8
*/

/* Question 6
 * Permutations without Dups: 
 * Write a method to compute all permutations of a string of unique characters.
*/

/* Question 7
 * Check Permutation: 
 * Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other.
*/

/* Question 8
 * Find Duplicates: 
 * You have an array with all the numbers from 1 to N, where N is at most 32,000. 
 * The array may have duplicate entries and you do not know what N is. With only 4 kilobytes 
 * of memory available, how would you print all duplicate elements in the array?
